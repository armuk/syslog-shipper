Ship logs to a syslog server
----------------------------

Usage: bin/syslog-shipper [options] -s HOST:PORT <path_or_glob> [path_or_glob2] [...]
  If a path begins with '+' each line is sent unmodified to the syslog server.
  Otherwise, this tool will prefix each line read from the file with a syslog
  header. 

  For example: syslog-shipper -s somehost:514 +/var/log/messages /var/log/apache2/access.log
